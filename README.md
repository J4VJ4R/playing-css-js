<a id="description"></a>
Exercise where we will to create with JS, HTML, CSS and SASS, a img with background color, blur and padding controls

## HTML

Is developed mainly to define our basic structure and start adding basic content such as text, images, video games among others.

The following is very important when working with html.


## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is the style language used to describe the presentation of HTML or XML documents (including various XML-based languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how the structured element should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or in other media.

CSS is one of the base languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the Open Web and has a standardized specification by the W3C. Previously, the development of various parts of the CSS specifications was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the recommendations. You have probably heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never been released as an official version.

Since CSS3, the scope of the specifications increased significantly and the progress of the different CSS modules began to show several differences, which made it more effective to develop and publish recommendations separated by modules. Instead of versioning the CSS specs, the W3C actually captures the latest stable CSS specs.

## JS

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time programming language with first-class functions. While it is best known as a scripting language (scripts) for web pages, it is used in many non-browser environments, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multiparadigm, single-threaded, dynamic programming language with support for object-oriented, imperative, and declarative programming (eg, functional programming).
